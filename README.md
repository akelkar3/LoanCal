# LoanCal
calculates monthly payment for multiple loans and pool of loans

# Assumptions
I developed the application based upon the giver requirements of the assignement and few assumptions like -
1. there will not be too many input entries. Like an excel import
2. SQL integration is not required.
3. The Loan amount entered has a limit say till 10^6
4. The terms are mentioned in months
5. All the amounts will be rounded upto 2 digits after decimal only for presentation where as the calculation is done on complete precision.
